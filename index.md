## Welcome to My Website!

I am a PhD candidate working in Research Innovation in Software Engineering (RISE) laboratory at university of North Texas.

My research includes working on problems on evolution-aware testing techniques for object-oriented systems, including test selection, prioritization and automation.
The current research is focused on:
1) Developing cost-effective regression testing techniques that address the testing process and domain contexts, 
2) Developing economic models that enable the adequate assessment of techniques and strategies, 
3) Empirical methodologies to evaluate cost-benefits related to testing techniques considering various factors such as testing context and a system's lifetime, and 
4) Empirical evaluation which involves various research questions on software testing techniques and problems.
